This code in Ansible can be used to prepare an infrastructure at home devices, things like DCHP and Bind Servers and even a Zabbix Server.

I'm planning to extend the functionality with servers like Nextcloud, Jitsi and some other services.

I'm configuring all of this things in LXD servers running inside a modest server placed in the living room...preferably in a silent server.
